      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Mahnaz, an 18-year-old student from Herat.
        I draw because I love it â€” itâ€™s a way for me to express my thoughts and feelings.
        A few months ago, I started studying painting seriously, and I'm learning more every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        But my creativity doesn't stop at drawing.
        I'm also passionate about computers. I enjoy working with different software, and right now I'm learning
        programming â€” starting with HTML, CSS, and Python.
        I love how code lets me build things and be creative in a whole new way!
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to that, Iâ€™m also an English teacher.
        Iâ€™ve spent years studying the language, and now I help others improve their skills.
        Teaching helps me grow too â€” it makes me more confident and connected with people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Art, computers, and teaching are all parts of my creative journey.
        I believe learning never stops, and Iâ€™m excited to keep growing and creating.
      </p>

      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        Besides painting and programming, I also enjoy photography.
        Capturing moments with my camera helps me see beauty in everyday life.
        I like taking photos of nature, skies, and simple things that tell a story.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also love spending time on detailed drawings â€” sometimes with pencil, sometimes digital.
        My drawings often show emotions, culture, and dreams.
